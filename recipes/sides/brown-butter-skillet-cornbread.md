# Brown Butter Skillet Cornbread

## Ingredients
* 12 T / 170 grams unsalted butter
* ½ c / 120 ml maple syrup
* 2 ¼ c / 530 ml buttermilk
* 3 large eggs
* 1 ½ c / 180 grams yellow cornmeal, fine or medium-coarse grind
* ½ c / 65 grams whole wheet flour
* ½ c / 65 grams all-purpose flour
* 1 ½ T / 18 grams baking powder
* 1 ½ t / 15 grams kosher salt
* ½ t / 5 grams baking soda

## Instructions
Heat oven to 375 degrees. On the stovetop, in a 11 or 12-inch skillet (ovenproof an preferably cast iron), 
melt the butter over even heat. Cook, swirling pan to slightly coat sides and bottom, until the foam subsides
and the butter turns a deep nut brown. (Watch carefully to see that it does not burn.)

Pour brown butter into a large bowl (Do not wipe out the pan) Whisk the maple syrup into the butter, then
whisk in the buttermlk. The mixture should be cool to the touch; if not, let cool before whisking in the eggs.
Then whisk in the cornmeal, flours, baking powder, salt, and baking soda.

If the skillet is no longer hot (cast iron retains heat longer than other metals), reheat it briefly on the
stove for a few minutes. Scrape batter back into it. Bake until the top is golden brown and a toothpick
inserted into it emerges clean, 30 to 40 minutes. Cool in the skillet for 10 minutes before slicing.
