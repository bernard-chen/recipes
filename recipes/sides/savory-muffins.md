# Savory muffins
## Ingredients
* 1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
* ¼ cup fine or medium cornmeal
* 2 tsp baking powder
* ½ tsp baking soda
* 1 tsp kosher salt
* ½ tsp freshly ground black pepper
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* 1 tsp onion powder
* 1 tsp sugar (optional, just enhances browning)
* 2 large eggs
* 1 cup buttermilk
* ¼ cup melted unsalted butter
* ¼ cup neutral oil

## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 375°F. Line a 12-cup muffin tin with liners or grease well with butter/nonstick spray.
2. Combine dry ingredients: In a large bowl, whisk together flour, cornmeal, baking powder, baking soda, salt, pepper, spices and sugar.
3. Whisk wet ingredients: In a medium bowl (or large measuring cup), whisk together eggs, buttermilk and both fats (melted butter + oil) until smooth and lightly frothy.
4. Combine gently: Pour wet into dry ingredients and fold together with a spatula just until no dry streaks remain. This batter should be thick but spoonable—like cornbread batter, not runny pancake batter.
5. Fill and top: Divide batter evenly among muffin cups (they’ll be about ¾ full). Add toppings or crumbs if using.
6. Bake for 18–22 minutes, until golden and a tester comes out clean. Rotate halfway for even browning if your oven tends to have hot spots.
7. Cool for 5 minutes in the tin, then transfer to a rack. Sprinkle with flaky salt while still warm, if desired.

## Notes
Add 1.5 cups of mix-ins, total (cheese, bacon, etc.).
