# Chicken, Ziti, and Broccoli

## Ingredients
* 1 lb ziti
* 3/4 lb chicken thighs, cut into pieces
* 1.5 cup broccoli florets
* 3 gloves garlic, minced 
* Cooking wine
* Corn starch
* Parmesan cheese (optional)

## Instructions
* Start boiling the pasta. 
* Marinade chicken with corn starch and wine.
* Sear both sides of chicken in a hot pan. Since the pieces are relatively small, that should ensure that it's cooked through.
* Remove chicken from the pan.
* Start steaming the broccoli.
* In the pan where the chicken was removed, start cooking garlic under medium heat. Let it cook a bit, and then deglaze the pan with either cooking wine or pasta water. 
* Add enough pasta water into the pan to reduce into a sauce. When it's partly reduced, add chicken and broccoli into the pan.
* When the pasta is cooked, add it to the pan and toss it to coat it well.
* Season with parmesan, salt, and pepper to taste, and serve.

Note: If the sauce isn't thickening enough, one can add more parmesan into the sauce before tossing it. Another option is to add a mix of corn starch and water (or chicken broth if you have it), and adding that to the sauce before the pasta. The corn starch needs some heat before it starts to thicken the sauce.
