# Pork Meatballs

## Ingredients
* 1 lb lean ground pork
* 10 leaves of napa cabbage
* 5 slices of ginger
* 2 green onions
* 5 T sesame oil
* 5 T soy sauce
* 2 t cornstarch
* 1/2 t salt

## Instructions
* Mince the napa cabbage leaves and put them into a mixing bowl.
* Mince ginger and thinly slice the green onions and add to the mixing bowl.
* Add sesame oil and mix until all of the vegetables are coated. Allow vegetables to sit with sesame oil for about 10 minutes.
* Add ground pork, soy sauce, cornstarch, and salt, and mix well.
* Bring several cups of water to a boil in a pot deep enough so that meatballs will float.
* Make meatballs by dipping a spoon into the boiling water, then using the spoon and one hand to form each ball. Use the spoon to place the meatball into the boiling water, thereby cleaning off the spoon again.
* Allow meatballs to cook for about 12 minutes.

It is also possible to add shrimp to these meatballs. In general, if the meatballs fall apart while boiling, consider reducing the amount of vegetables. If the mixture is too wet to make the balls, add a little more cornstarch or reduce the liquids next time.
